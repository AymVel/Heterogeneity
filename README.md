###Introduction

The project aim is to develop an existing computer application called FLAMEGPU, a high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) extension tothe FLAME framework that provides a mapping between a formal agentspecifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code to supportscalable muti-agent simulation.  The plan it to expand/extend features andcapabilities of the exiting <a href="https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU">FLAMEGPU software</a>, in order to position it as amiddleware for complex systems simulation.The application is expected to be the equivalent of Thrust for sim-plifying complex systems on GPUs.  The FLAMEGPU library would includeadditional algorithms such as spatial partitioning, network communication,and  etc.   These  could  be  either  incorporated  into  a  separate  library  or  a module.
